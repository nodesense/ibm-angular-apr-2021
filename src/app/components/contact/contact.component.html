<p>contact works!</p>

<!-- app-address is not accessible until it is exported from shared module-->

<!-- contact is parent component, address is child component

    In Angular, we can pass data from parent to child using,
            1. Property Binding []
            2. @Input()
-->

<!--reuse address component -->

<app-address  [address]="headOffice"
              title="Head Office"
              
              (callEvent)="handleCall($event)"
              (email)="handleEmail($event)"
              
              >
</app-address>

<app-address [address]="branchOffice"
             title="Branch Office"

             (callEvent)="handleCall($event)"
             (email)="handleEmail($event)"
             
             >
</app-address>

<!-- branchOffice is undefined/null will cause exception,
     will stop angular rendering-->

<!-- 
    ?. - elvis operator, for template null/undefined checking
            if obj is null/undefined, it will not render/resolve attributes
-->
<p>City {{branchOffice?.city}}</p>
